# [Clustering the Ethereum Address Space](https://thomasdelatte.com/2021/04/clustering-ethereum-addresses/)

See my blog post on this project [here](https://thomasdelatte.com/2021/04/clustering-ethereum-addresses/).

Users may be anonymous on the Ethereum blockchain, but their addresses are unique identifiers that leave publicly available transactional data. After building a dataset gathering this public data, I attempt to create meaningful categories of users (Miners, Exchanges,...) by dividing the Ethereum address space in clusters. A small percentage of labeled addresses in the dataset allows me to re-cluster the data to leverage this information, using a constrained version of the K-Means algorithm.
